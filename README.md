A randomly layed out dungeon generator.

## Software Analasis 
Dungeons have many variations but to keep it a more simplistic you might prefer using engines like Unity or Gamemaker.
These engines have an easy and reliable gameobject system where you can make presets of it.
Also a great feature of it is that you can attach a script with a build in API from the game-engine.
These are very usefull for creating an easy form of recursion.

Another advanced method I could apply to this system is a term called perlin noise.
What this does it points certain locations with a value and then it makes a smooth transition to its adjecent locations.
This can be used abroad the dungeon to make certain things happen on specific values. For instance where a value is high it spawns a valueable item or an enemy.


## Learning goals 
- Able to create a recursion flow
- What perlin noise is.

## Planning 
| | monday | tuesday | wednesday | thursday | friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|week 1 | researching perlin noise | programming the perlin noise | making room presets | making the recursion of room spawning | bug fixing |
|week 2 | make a player | make items spawn by perlin noise | fine tuning |
